To ensure that the blog design is not confused, this project does not accept suggestions for design changes, such as color scheme, fonts, typography, etc. If your request is about an enhancement, it is recommended to first submit a `Feature Request` type issue to discuss whether your idea fits the project. 

Generally, contribute to the project by:
