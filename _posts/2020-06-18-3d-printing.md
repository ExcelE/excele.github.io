So early this summer, I got myself a 3D printer. With me spending more time indoors, figured I can learn a thing or two about CAD and 3D Printing. 

Went to Micro Center to get my Ender 3.

Assembled the parts and the motherboard was broken, so I went back to Micro Center and replaced it with a CR-10S.

I'm very impressed.
