Early this summer, I decided to get a 3D Printer. Went to Micro Center and got an Ender 3.

Went home excited only to be disappointed when I found out the motherboard was broken after painful hours of assembly. Went back the next day to return.

I splurged a but more money to replace it with CR-10S. A better experience than the Ender 3, especially for a beginner.
