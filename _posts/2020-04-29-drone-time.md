With the quarantine stretching for months, I ~~impulsively~~ bought a DJI Mavic Mini.

Holding the drone awed me on its capabilities. It really gives you more options on setting the scene for some of your creative projects in mind.

What really sucks though is I live near JFK so I have to walk a bit farther to deploy it. The app won't actually allow you to take off the drone unless you get permission (a really lengthy process, I don't want to).

Will have some footages soon.
